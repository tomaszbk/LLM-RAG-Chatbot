          "Overwatch (retroactively referred to as Overwatch 1[b]) was a 2016 tea<br>m-based multiplayer first-person shooter game by Blizzard Entertainmen<br>t. The game was first released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox On<br>e in May 2016 and Nintendo Switch in October 2019. Cross-platform play<br> was supported across all platforms.<br>",
          "Described as a \"hero shooter\", Overwatch assigned players into two tea<br>ms of six, with each player selecting from a large roster of character<br>s, known as \"heroes\", with unique abilities. Teams worked to complete <br>map-specific objectives within a limited period of time. Blizzard adde<br>d new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, all free of charg<br>e, with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes <br>to purchase cosmetic items.<br>",
          "design was to encourage dynamic team compositions that adapt to the si<br>tuation. The game's genre has been described by some journalists as a <br>\"hero shooter\", due to its design around specific heroes and classes.[<br>5][6]<br>",
